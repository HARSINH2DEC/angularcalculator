--NOTE :--

Javascript is called a prototype based language.

Different objects have properties and methods defined in constructor available to them .

In classical OOP when a constructor is instanciated all new properties are added to the instances

BUT in OOJS all propertes and methods of a constructor are linked to new instances via the word "prototype"
