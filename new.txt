<<<The new key word >>>

 -->Defination :-

 The "new" keyword creates an instance of a user defined object type or a built in  object type that has a constructor function .

-->Syntax :-


   new constructor[([arguments])]


-->Parameters :-

     1)Constructor  :- A class or function that specifies the type of the object instance.
     2)Arguments    :- A list of values that the constructor will be called with.

-->Execution :-

When the js engine comes across new Object() following things happen :-
     
     1)A new object is created inherited from prototype.

     2)The new object function is called with specified arguments , the "this" keyword is then bound to the newly created object .

     3)We can add different values to the properties to all object of same type 

-->  Function.prototype property :-
 
 This defines a property that is shared by all objects created with that function, rather than by just one instance of the object type


( question )  How is using new keyword and inheritance different ?
